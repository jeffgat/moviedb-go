This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## GameOn Take

Task: Create a Responsive Movie Database Interface
Build a responsive movie database interface using Next.js, React, and TypeScript. You should use The Movie Database (TMDB) API or any similar public API to fetch movie data. The interface should have the following features:
1. Movie List View: This is the main page where users can see a list of popular movies. Each movie card should display the movie poster, 􏰀tle, release date, and ra􏰀ng.
2. Search Func􏰀onality: Add a search bar at the top of the Movie List View. When a user types into the search bar, the movie list should update in real 􏰀me to only show movies that match the search query.
3. Movie Detail View: When a user clicks on a movie card, they should be taken to a Movie Detail View. This view should display more informa􏰀on about the movie, like a detailed descrip􏰀on, director, cast, etc.
4. Responsive Design: The applica􏰀on should be fully responsive and work on a variety of screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
5. Visual Effects: Implement visual effects such as loading anima􏰀ons, hover effects on movie cards, smooth transi􏰀ons between different views.
6. Error Handling: The applica􏰀on should properly handle poten􏰀al errors, such as failed API requests, and give suitable feedback to the user.
